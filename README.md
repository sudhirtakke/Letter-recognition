# Letter-recognition
Letter recognition using diff ML algorithms - use of bagging and boosting methods

In the given dataset we have 'letter' as a target variable which has English alphabet and the remaining features are the independent variables which are used to predict the English Alphabet

We have two sets of datasets, train and test separately. Train set of data will be used to train the models using difefrent algorithms and finally we use the trained models on Test data to predict the dependent variable i.e. letter.
